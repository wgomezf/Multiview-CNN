This demo function shows how to build a multi-view convolutional neural network for classifying breast tumors into benign and malignant classes. 
Before running this demo, download and install the ResNet18 network (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/68261-deep-learning-toolbox-model-for-resnet-18-network). 
All the functions were developed and tested in Matlab 2024b.
